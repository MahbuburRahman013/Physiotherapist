                        Physiotherapy is a science and increasingly evidence-based practice, with the aim to restore movement and function. It can also help to reduce your risk of injury or illness in the future. Consultations take a "holistic" approach to your health; looking at all aspects of life which are affected by pain, dysfunction, biomechanics, posture, disease, or aging.
